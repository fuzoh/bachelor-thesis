Abstract = {Organizations have to act in environments that are constantly becoming
   more insecure, dynamic, and competitive. Practitioner and scholar
   literature continue to call for and explore new work arrangements. The
   concept of Holacracy - often referred to as a `new form of organizing' -
   represents a reaction to the increasing complexity and environmental
   dynamics that organizations have to deal with. It promises a new way to
   run organizations and aims to replace traditional hierarchical and
   bureaucratic structures in organizations with decentralized authority
   and self-organization. This article looks beyond the recent hype about
   Holacracy and analyses what is actually novel about the concept. In
   specific, we aim at identifying the core principles of the concept and
   discuss them against the background of bureaucratic and
   post-bureaucratic approaches to review whether and how Holacracy
   deviates from these two approaches. We do so by applying a qualitative
   analysis method where the book `Holacracy' was subjected to content
   analysis. The results of this paper demonstrate that - given the high
   degree of formal standardization - the concept itself is still
   bureaucratic, although with certain modifications, especially regarding
   participative decision-making processes. Further, our results
   demonstrate that Holacracy has a very unique and unprecedented
   interpretation of power and authority, which requires more intensive
   empirical research and analysis.},

Abstract = {Purpose Firms are challenged by digital transformation, as their
   organizational design is not up to par. Mercedes-Benz.io, a 100\%
   subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG Daimler group, employs Holacracy, a
   self-management framework that abolishes traditional hierarchies in
   order to be more responsive to changes. This paper aims to explore how
   Mercedes-Benz.io utilizes Holacracy in order to address the challenges
   posed by digital transformation. Design/methodology/approach Using
   qualitative expert interviews, the authors show that organizational life
   becomes more meaningful but also more engaging and demanding. The
   authors highlight that agile principles can be embedded in the
   organizational structure, a strong contrast to conventional management
   design. Decision-making authority and accountability is decentralized
   toward employees who face operational realities. This fosters commitment
   but might prolong the decision process. Leadership seems to be fairly
   contextual, and career paths are fundamentally different; development
   avenues are rather functional. Findings The authors conclude that
   Holacracy seems suitable for industries where the need for adaptability
   outweighs the need for reliability. It leads to increased transparency
   and accountability but is not a ready-made solution and requires ample
   resources. Originality/value This study is one of the first that
   qualitatively assess the changes, implications and outcomes of
   organizations that employ Holacracy.},

Title = {Holacracy: redefining organizational ontology and epistemology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 25},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine Holacracy as a self-management system
   and its implications for organizational theory. By exploring its
   distinctive ontology and epistemology, the paper explains how Holacracy
   redefines organizational structures and contributes to organizational
   change. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a conceptual approach, this
   essay draws upon existing literature to explore Holacracy's departure
   from conventional organizational theories. Findings The paper discusses
   how Holacracy challenges traditional organizational concepts, defining
   its holarchical approach, and emphasizing dynamic hierarchies and
   role-based organization. It also highlights Holacracy's focus on
   emergent intelligence, continuous feedback loops and structured
   knowledge acquisition through roles and organization spaces. By
   examining its unique ontology and epistemology, the paper offers
   insights into how Holacracy aligns with an emergent paradigm known as
   integral, metamodern or teal. Research limitations/implicationsFurther
   empirical research is needed to assess its practical implementation and
   long-term effects on organizational performance and employee well-being.
   Future studies could also explore challenges and limitations associated
   with adopting Holacracy in different organizational contexts. Practical
   implications Organizations considering alternative ways of working
   should examine Holacracy. Implementing Holacracy requires understanding
   its principles and may involve significant changes, with potential
   benefits such as increased agility and employee engagement. Social
   implications Holacracy's departure from traditional structures and
   approach to power can have broader social implications and contribute to
   more democratic and participatory cultures. Originality/valueThis paper
   is a pioneering contribution to the under-researched domain of
   alternative organizational models. It sheds light on the originality and
   distinctiveness of Holacracy, highlighting its unique approach to
   hierarchy, role-based organization and consciousness within
   organizations.},

abstract = {The retrospective is a crucial component of the agile software development process. In previous studies of retrospectives in undergraduate team software development projects, students exhibited limited and shallow reflection. We speculate that this is due to students' limited experience with reflection and the absence of clear guidance for engaging in deep reflection during agile retrospectives. To explore the potential for a pedagogical intervention to foster deeper reflection in retrospectives, we present an empirical comparison of a standard retrospective model against an enhanced retrospective model that scaffolds deeper levels of reflection by prompting students to justify and critique their practices and weigh alternative approaches. Through a systematic classification of the reflection level of statements made during individual brainstorming and team discussion phases of retrospectives, our study found that the enhanced model led to individuals and teams engaging in significantly higher levels of reflection. Our findings contribute to improving software engineering education by demonstrating the efficacy of an enhanced pedagogical model for team retrospectives.},

@article{ self-organization-and-Governance-in-digital-platform-ecosystems-engert,
Abstract = {This research investigates the interplay of top-down control and bottom-up self-organization within digital platform ecosystems (DPEs), focusing on the formation and management of complementor coalitions. Although these coalitions can increase a DPE's generativity, they can also threaten its integrity. We investigate this tension by employing information ecology (IE) theory, which allows us to examine complementor coalitions as holons that navigate between self-assertiveness and integration within the structural hierarchies of DPEs. Utilizing an inductive, embedded case-study approach, we analyze the interplay between top-down control exerted by platform owners and the bottom-up selforganization of complementors in two enterprise software platform ecosystems. Our findings identify three distinct interaction modes—mandated, supported, and autonomous self-organization—each presenting hierarchical trade-offs between platform owner control and complementor autonomy. Our findings extend th},

@article{entrainment-of-task-allocation-and-release-cycles-in-open-source-software-development,
Abstract = {In this study we identify a process of "entrainment" around open source software (OSS) development release cycles to capture patterns of self-organized task allocation among developers. We conducted an abductive, computationally intensive study of eight OSS projects, using relational event modeling to analyze 1,169,489 actions covering 93 major software releases. The process of entrainment that we identify involves three task allocation mechanisms: (1) developer-issue inertia, (2) developer contribution frequency, and (3) issue popularity. Our analysis demonstrates that these mechanisms and the phases of the release cycle entrain each other. Before a major release, developers engage in a concentrated mobilization phase, whereby they democratize development activity and increasingly allocate community contributions to the set of issues related to the release. After a major release, the extended cleanup phase garners a greater share of development work from recently highly active develo},
